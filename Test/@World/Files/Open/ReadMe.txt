========================= FOLDERS ==================================
All documents for the World objects should be stored here in sub-directories.

For example, if your "User" type has a property named "ProfilePicture", then you should have a folder named "User.ProfilePicture".


========================= Files =====================================
The files of your World records should be stored in the appropriate sub folders with the usual record GUID file names.
